    prev.total_revenue AS revenue_previous_year,
    curr.total_revenue AS revenue_current_year,
    (curr.total_revenue - prev.total_revenue) AS revenue_change
FROM (
    SELECT "Branch", "Year", SUM("Total_price") AS total_revenue
    FROM walmart_data
    GROUP BY "Branch", "Year"
) curr
JOIN (
    SELECT "Branch", "Year", SUM("Total_price") AS total_revenue
    FROM walmart_data
    GROUP BY "Branch", "Year"
) prev
ON curr."Branch" = prev."Branch" AND curr."Year" = prev."Year" + 1
ORDER BY revenue_change ASC;
